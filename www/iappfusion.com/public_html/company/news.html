			<strong><u>6/7/2011 Louisville, KY</u></strong>
			<p>
			Louisville, Kentucky's local mobile app company, iAppFusion, LLC, is proud to announce Pondwater™ 2.0.
			</p>
			<p>
			Pondwater is iAppFusion's proprietary, secure database storage system stored "In The Cloud".  The Pondwater platform originated for gathering sensor data over four years ago, and has undergone extensive
changes in the last year to adopt it for mobile data and mobile apps. It allows iAppFusion to store data from multiple sources and users and provides a secure transaction layer to access the data.  The latest
version of Pondwater was specifically designed to ease the pain of integrating disparate databases across multiple, mobile platforms and provide robust reporting and data analytics.  With this tool, we are able to merge and store different, large-scale data sets with ease.
			</p>
			<p>
			It has allowed iAppFusion to create "Framework" apps, into which different data sets can be dropped in.  For example, the company created a beer database app called BrewHaHa.  iAppFusion was then able to take the framework and drop in a cigar database for The Humidor app.  iAppFusion can take any database, do some re-skinning on the app and publish.  It takes roughly two weeks per app.  This has been deployed on the iPhone/iPod/iPad and Windows Phone 7 platforms.
			</p>
			<p>
			Additionally, it also serves as our proprietary set of API's that enables secure data access and communication.  Each app or project or app has it's own set of API's.  Some examples of API’s for current
projects can be viewed at <a href="http://www.duckstick.com">www.duckstick.com</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			When an app is first used, it hits Pondwater via a Web Service.  An account is then created for access to the data, a unique GUID for each mobile device is stored and a unique key is issued for each device.
Based on the person's credentials, iAppFusion's back-end system manages and maintains exactly what data each user is limited to.  As more data permissions are granted to an individual, Pondwater, in turn, upgrades the license to afford the user additional data access.
			</p>
			<p>
			One of the biggest benefits to using Pondwater is it gives iAppFusion the ability to collect real-time consumer patterns.  Each time an app is used, iAppFusion collects the location, the amount of time the app
was used, a time/date stamp and the features used.  This data can be stored and used for reporting and data analytics to provide very powerful marketing information.
			</p>
			<p>
			Pondwater can be licensed to third parties to run on their own servers.  Contact iAppFusion for details on the exciting database innovation that is Pondwater.

			<strong><u>Keep Louisville Local: App for that.</u></strong>
			<p>	iAppFusion Partner and President, Bob Henzel is interviewed
				by the <a href="http://leoweekly.com/news/keep-louisville-local-app">
					Louisville Kentucky LEO Weekly.</a>"We were saying that we want to really attack the corporate
					side, but at the same time, we don't want to just ignore the fun side, so we started iAppFusion and
					iBroomCloset, and built it such that every application we're making in one, we make pieces of it
					for the other. And as more of our friends got involved, it became a legitimate company, and we just
					have a blast doing it. It's just so much fun -- we don't even consider it work at this point."
				</p>

				<strong><u>Even your dog can have Justin Bieber's hairdo with iPhone app.</u></strong>
				<p>	iAppFusion Partner and CEO, Rob Walrath is interviewed by the Louisville Kentucky Courier Journal.
					Walrath's iBroomCloset oozes crazy-app sensibility: "Having sacrificed our personal and professional
					lives to the pursuit of triviality, we are truly fulfilled," the company profile crows.Walrath said,
					"iBroomCloset is for fun, silly applications, but we make data-intensive apps custom-designed for
					business at our other company, iAppFusion.
